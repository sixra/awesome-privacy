  The API allows you to browse awesome-privacy's data programmatically.
  It also runs some lookups/checks on listings to surface useful insights
  to add additional context to listings, and save time when comparing software / services.
  <br>
  These endpoints are used by as part of the website generation,
  the PR review process and the scheduled listing audits.
  You're also free to use it for your own purposes.
  <br>
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > It's very important not to rely on this data for any decision making,
  > as it only gives a very narrow slice of the picture.
  > There's also many real privacy issues which the automated lookups have no way of detecting,
  > as well as the possibility for false positives/negatives.
  > **Always do your own research**.

<details>
<summary>Authenticating</summary>

By default, no auth is needed.
If you're self-hosting, you can enable auth by setting the \`API_KEY\` env var.
Then, add the \`Authorization: Bearer <your-token>\` header when accessing the enrichment endpoints.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Caching</summary>

Some responses are cached to reduce load on upstream services.
When configured, successful enrichment data results are put in KV for upto 7 days.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Self-Hosting</summary>

See the [repo](https://github.com/lissy93/awesome-privacy/tree/main/api) for
deployment and development guides, as well as instructions for self-hosting, contributing and usage.
